Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection.
The infection causes flu-like illness, and occasionally develops into a potentially lethal 
complication called severe dengue.
The global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades. About half of the 
world's population is now at risk.
Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban
areas.
Severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some Asian and 
Latin American countries.
There is no specific treatment for dengue/ severe dengue, but early detection and access to 
proper medical care lowers fatality rates below 1%.
Dengue prevention and control depends on effective vector control measures.
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for dengue fever.

For severe dengue, medical care by physicians and nurses experienced with the effects and 
progression of the disease can save lives – decreasing mortality rates from more than 20% to 
less than 1%. Maintenance of the patient's body fluid volume is critical to severe dengue care.
