Fever is when a human's body temperature goes above the normal 
range of 36–37° Centigrade (98–100° Fahrenheit). It is a common 
medical sign.
Other terms for a fever include pyrexia and controlled hyperthermia.
Symptoms
feeling cold when nobody else does
shivering
lack of appetite
dehydration — preventable if the person drinks plenty of fluids
depression
hyperalgesia, or increased sensitivity to pain
lethargy
problems concentrating
sleepiness
sweating
If the fever is high, there may also be extreme irritability, 
confusion, delirium, and seizures.

Treatment
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or 
ibuprofen can help bring a fever down. These are available to 
purchase over-the-counter or online. However, a mild fever may be 
helping combat the bacterium or virus that is causing the infection
. It may not be ideal to bring it down.

If the fever has been caused by a bacterial infection, the doctor 
may prescribe an antibiotic.

If a fever has been caused by a cold, which is caused by a viral 
infection, NSAIDs may be used to relieve uncomfortable symptoms. 
Antibiotics have no effect against viruses and will not be 
prescribed by your doctor for a viral infection.

Fluid intake: Anyone with a fever should consume plenty of fluids 
to prevent dehydration. Dehydration will complicate any illness.

Heat stroke: NSAIDs will not be effective if the person's fever was
caused by hot weather or sustained strenuous exercise. The patient
needs to be cooled. If they are confused or unconscious, they should
be treated by a doctor straight away.

Causes
Fever can be caused by a number of factors:

an infection, such as strep throat, flu, chickenpox, or pneumonia
rheumatoid arthritis
some medications
overexposure of skin to sunlight, or sunburn
heat stroke, resulting either by exposure to high temperatures or 
prolonged strenuous exercise
dehydration
silicosis, a type of lung disease caused by long-term exposure to 
silica dust
amphetamine abuse
alcohol withdrawal
