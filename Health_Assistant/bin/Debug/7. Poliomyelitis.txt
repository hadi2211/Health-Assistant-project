Polio (poliomyelitis) mainly affects children under 5 years of age.
1 in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% die when their breathing 
muscles become immobilized.
Cases due to wild poliovirus have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated 350 000 cases then, to 33
reported cases in 2018.
As long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio. Failure
to eradicate polio from these last remaining strongholds could result in as many as 200 000 new cases every year,
within 10 years, all over the world.
In most countries, the global effort has expanded capacities to tackle other infectious diseases by building 
effective surveillance and immunization systems.
Symptoms
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. It invades the nervous system, and can cause total 
paralysis in a matter of hours. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the 
faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food) and 
multiplies in the intestine. Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and
pain in the limbs. 1 in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis (usually in the legs). Among those 
paralysed, 5% to 10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.
Prevention
There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child 
for life.
