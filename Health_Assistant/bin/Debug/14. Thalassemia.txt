Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by less hemoglobin and fewer red blood cells in your body
than normal. Hemoglobin is the substance in your red blood cells that allows them to carry oxygen. The low hemoglobin and fewer red 
blood cells of thalassemia may cause anemia, leaving you fatigued.

If you have mild thalassemia, you may not need treatment. But if you have a more severe form of the disorder, you may need regular 
blood transfusions. You can also take steps on your own to cope with fatigue, such as choosing a healthy diet and exercising regularly.

Symptoms
Thalassemia signs and symptoms may include:

Fatigue
Weakness
Pale or yellowish skin
Facial bone deformities
Slow growth
Abdominal swelling
Dark urine
Several types of thalassemia exist, including alpha-thalassemia, thalassemia intermedia and Cooley anemia. The signs and symptoms you
experience depend on the type and severity of your condition. Some babies show signs and symptoms of thalassemia at birth, while others
may develop them during the first two years of life. Some people who have only one affected hemoglobin gene don't experience any 
thalassemia symptoms.

When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with your child's doctor for an evaluation if he or she has any signs or symptoms that worry you.
Causes
Thalassemia is caused by mutations in the DNA of cells that make hemoglobin — the substance in your red blood cells that carries 
oxygen throughout your body. The mutations associated with thalassemia are passed from parents to children.

Thalassemia disrupts the normal production of hemoglobin and healthy red blood cells. This causes anemia. With anemia, your blood doesn't
have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your tissues — leaving you fatigued.
Prevention
In most cases, you can't prevent thalassemia. If you have thalassemia, or if you carry a thalassemia gene, consider talking with a 
genetic counselor for guidance if you're thinking of having children. .
