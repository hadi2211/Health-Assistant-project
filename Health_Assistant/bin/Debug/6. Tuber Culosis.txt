Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also damage other parts of the body.

TB spreads through the air when a person with TB of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, or talks. If you have been exposed, you should go to your doctor for tests. You are more likely to get TB if you have a weak immune 
system.

Symptoms of TB in the lungs may include

A bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer
Weight loss
Loss of appetite
Coughing up blood or mucus
Weakness or fatigue
Fever
Night sweats
Skin tests, blood tests, x-rays, and other tests can tell if you have TB. If not treated properly, TB can be deadly. You can usually cure active TB by taking several medicines for a long period of time.
See your doctor if you have a fever, unexplained weight loss, drenching night sweats or a persistent cough. These are often signs of TB, but they can also result from other medical problems. Your doctor can perform tests 
to help determine the cause.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have an increased risk of tuberculosis be screened for latent TB infection. This recommendation includes people who:

Have HIV/AIDS
Use IV drugs
Are in contact with infected individuals
Are from a country where TB is common, such as several countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia
Live or work in areas where TB is common, such as prisons or nursing homes
Work in health care and treat people with a high risk of TB
Are children and are exposed to adults at risk of TB .
