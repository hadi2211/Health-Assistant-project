Hair loss can affect just your scalp or your entire body. It can be the result of heredity, 
hormonal changes, medical conditions or medications. Anyone can experience hair loss, but it's 
more common in men.

Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. Hereditary hair loss with age is the most 
common cause of baldness. Some people prefer to let their hair loss run its course untreated and unhidden. 
Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats or scarves. And still others choose one of the treatments 
available to prevent further hair loss and to restore growth.

Before pursuing hair loss treatment, talk with your doctor about the cause of your hair loss and treatment 
options.

Symptoms
Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or 
gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Some types of hair loss are temporary, and others are 
permanent.

Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include:

Gradual thinning on top of head. This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting both men and women as they
age. In men, hair often begins to recede from the forehead in a line that resembles the letter M. Women 
typically retain the hairline on the forehead but have a broadening of the part in their hair.
Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people experience smooth, coin-sized bald spots. This type of hair loss 
usually affects just the scalp, but it sometimes also occurs in beards or eyebrows. In some cases, your skin 
may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out.
Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come 
out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes 
overall hair thinning and not bald patches.
Full-body hair loss. Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the

loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back.
Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair
, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing.
When to see a doctor
See your doctor if your child or you are distressed by hair loss and want to pursue treatment. Also talk to your\doctor 
if you notice sudden or patchy hair loss or more than usual hair loss when combing or washing your or your
 child's hair. Sudden hair loss can signal an underlying medical condition that requires treatment .
