Key facts
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people 
through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable.
In 2017, there were an estimated 219 million cases of malaria in 87 countries.
The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 435 000 in 2017.
The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. 
In 2017, the region was home to 92% of malaria cases and 93% of malaria deaths.
Total funding for malaria control and elimination reached an estimated US$ 3.1 billion in 2017. Contributions from governments of endemic countries amounted to US$ 900 million, representing 28% of total funding.
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. The parasites are spread to people through the 
bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, called "malaria vectors." There are 5 parasite 
species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. 
vivax – pose the greatest threat.

In 2017, P. falciparum accounted for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in the WHO African Region
, as well as in the majority of cases in the WHO regions of South-East Asia (62.8%), the 
Eastern Mediterranean (69%) and the Western Pacific (71.9%).
P. vivax is the predominant parasite in the WHO Region of the Americas, representing 74.1% of 
malaria cases.
Symptoms
Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 
days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may 
be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, P. falciparum 
malaria can progress to severe illness, often leading to death.

Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe 
anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults,
 multi-organ failure is also frequent. In malaria endemic areas, people may develop partial 
immunity, allowing asymptomatic infections to occur.
Prevention
Vector control is the main way to prevent and reduce malaria transmission. If coverage of 
vector control interventions within a specific area is high enough, then a measure of 
protection will be conferred across the community.

WHO recommends protection for all people at risk of malaria with effective malaria vector 
control. Two forms of vector control – insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor residual 
spraying – are effective in a wide range of circumstances.
